# Description
This repo contains codes to run the DDRJ for ROIs and SNPs selection.

1. /data contains the real dataset that motivates the problem
2. /model contains the implementation for the 3 algorithms ( **ddrj_roi** for rois selection, **ddrj_snp** for snps selection, **ddrj_roi_snp** for joint rois and snps selection)
3. /utils contains some functions to simulate or retrieve the real dataset and other utility function

# Code structure 

Any of the **ddrj_roi**, **ddrj_snp**, **ddrj_roi_snp** follows the same structure
1. simulate or retrieve real data 
2. Define paramaters (number of mcmc chains, iterations)
3. Run mcmc chains and check convergence 
4. Get marginal posterior probability of inclusion of each variable  for variable selection
5. Get Posterior mean and 95 Credible interval for the coefficients of selected variables, 
6. Get posterior probability for the visited models
7. Do Bayesian model averaging for prediction and compute MCE Aand AUC
