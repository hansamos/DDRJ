# DDRJ

The Data Driven Reversible Jump-DDRJ package implements a series of Bayesian method for variable selection in genetics:

1. DDRJ for identifying main QTLs with non dense genetic map and continuous response variable published in https://www.genetics.org/content/202/1/25.supplemental
2. DDRJ for identifying main and epistatic QTLs with non dense genetic map and continuous response variable  published in published in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/92903882021);
3. DDRJ for identifying SNPs and continous variables ROIs with   binary response variable (paper under review)
