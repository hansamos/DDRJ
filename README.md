# DDRJ

The Data Driven Reversible Jump-DDRJ package implements a series of Bayesian method for variable selection in genetics:

1. DDRJ for identifying main QTLs with non dense genetic map and continuous response variable published in https://www.genetics.org/content/202/1/25.supplemental
2. DDRJ for identifying main and epistatic QTLs with non dense genetic map and continuous response variable  published in published https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tb/2022/03/09290388/1prKB112BdC;
3. DDRJ for identifying SNPs and continous variables ROIs with   binary response variable https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01134.pdf
