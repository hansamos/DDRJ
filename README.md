# DDRJ

The Data Driven Reversible Jump-DDRJ package implements a series of Bayesian method for variable selection in genetics:

1. DDRJ for identifying main QTLs with non dense genetic map and continuous response variable published in https://www.genetics.org/content/202/1/25.supplemental
2. DDRJ for identifying main and epistatic QTLs with non dense genetic map and continuous response variable  published in published in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/92903882021);
3.  DDRJ for identifying  SNPs and continuous covariates  with  continuous response variable (paper to be submitted)
4. DDRJ for identifying SNPs and continous variables with   binary response variable (paper to be submitted)
